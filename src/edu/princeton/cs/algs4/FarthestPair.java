/**
 *  WARNING: THIS IMPLEMENTATION HAS A BUG. DOES NOT MATCH FARTHESTPAIRBRUTE

 *  
 *  The <tt>FarthestPair</tt> data type computes the farthest pair of points
 *  in a set of <em>n</em> points in the plane and provides accessor methods
 *  for getting the farthest pair of points and the distance between them.
 *  The distance between two points is their Euclidean distance.

 *  This implementation computes the convex hull of the set of points and
 *  uses the rotating calipers method to find all antipodal point pairs
 *  and the farthest pair.
 *  It runs in O(<em>n</em> log <em>n</em>) time in the worst case and uses
 *  O(<em>N</em>) extra space.
 *  See also {@link ClosestPair} and {@link GrahamScan}.
